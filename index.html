  <h1>And she wants an empire.</h1>
  <p>The Slug Queen resides in the cooler climates of Iceland, preferring to winter near the geothermally warmed sands of volcanic fields.</p>
  <p>She will build an empire and teach her new community the secrets of galactic witchcraft, known only to those who travel long distances beyond the Milky Way Galaxy. Together with this knowledge, the Slug Queen and her community of femme and nb followers will achieve their ultimate goal: smash the patriarchy.</p>
  <p>Roll D20 to cast an enchantment over assholes who will then fetch you a cup of coffee, at which time the enchantment will evaporate. They will be better people thereafter. </p>
